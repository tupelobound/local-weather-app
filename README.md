freeCodeCamp legacy project - Show the Local Weather

This project originally formed part of the Intermediate Front End Development certificate, which focused heavily on interacting with APIs.

The project brief was to fulfill the following user stories:

1.  I can see the weather in my current location.
2.  I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3.  I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

This was also a fun project to experiment with CSS gradient colours.

There is a slight issue with the API that sometimes reports a location in Japan if too many requests are made in a short space of time:

Originally completed in Feb 2018. Would like to revisit to add functionality for finding the weather in other locations.
